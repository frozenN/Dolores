# Dolores 

__Dolores__ is nothing but a language built with ANTLR4 following an excellent tutorial froom the website [Progur] (http://progur.com/2016/09/how-to-create-language-using-antlr4.html).

I made with as a learning exercise, in order to get more practice on using APIs, JARs & etc (same purpose of the LeagueOfLegends project on my repositories). 
It's also a funny language based on the excellent Tv Show [WestWorld](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475784/).

# Future Learning Plans

(Basicly a section for my-future-self)
- Add all primary math operations such as -, *, /
- Add text print options
- Add arrays option
