# Dolores 

__Dolores__ is nothing but a language built with ANTLR4 following an excellent tutorial froom the website [http://progur.com/2016/09/how-to-create-language-using-antlr4.html](Progur).

I made with as a learning exercise, in order to get more practice on using APIs, JARs & etc. It's also a funny language based on the Tv Show WestWorld.

# Future Learning Plans

(Basicly a section for my-future-self)
- Add all primary math operations such as -, *, /
- Add text print options
- Add arrays option
